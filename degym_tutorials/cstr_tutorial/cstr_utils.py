    Compute initial reaction rate for the CSTR Simple Reaction problem.

    The reaction rate is a function of temperature based on the Arrhenius equation:
        k = k_0 * exp{âˆ’E_a / RT}

    Args:
        k_0: Pre-exponential factor.
        e: E_a, the activation energy of the reaction.
        r: R, Ideal gas constant
        t: T, Temperature in the reactor.
    Returns:
        k, the reaction rate.

    rate: float = k_0 * np.exp(-e / (r * t))
